# Building Barkpass

This is a blog about [Barkpass](https://www.barkpass.com), a dog park management and pet licensing software. It's built with [Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev), a React framework and SDK that you can use to build fast and dynamic Shopify custom storefronts. _This isn't a storefront, but I'm using it anyway as a blog_.
